                    AngularJS - Superheroic JavaScript Framework as they say it.Is it really superheroic <i class="em em-thinking_face"></i>
                    will check it out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started my carrier in web development as a AngularJS developer and i was super excited to learn
                    and implement the superheroic
                    concepts of angularjs to build a real project.The features of angularjs like two-way binding,
                    dependency injection and others
                    are super cool and seems easy to implement to build a scalable and fast web application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we will go through some of the concepts of AngularJS to get started to build a web application
                    in angularjs.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    The concept
                </h4>
                <p>
                    AngularJS is single page application which is build on MVC pattern.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    Model View Controller(MVC) is a software design pattern for applications. In this pattern,
                    different features are broken into components to separate responsibilities. The model contains the
                    data and logic, the view contains the visual layout and presentation, while the controller connects
                    the two.
                </blockquote>

                    <div class="img-desc">MVC implementation in AngularJS</div>

                <p>
                    <strong>Module</strong> Module is a container which binds different parts of the application
                    together
                    so they can interact with each other.It specify how angular application should be bootstraped.<br>
                    <div class="container flex-center article-img-div">
                        <img class="article-img half-image" src="/assets/img/angular-module.png">
                        <div class="img-desc">This is how angular module binds all part of app </div>
                    </div>
                    <strong>Controllers</strong> It is used to control and manage a part of your UI.Using controller
                    you can write business
                    logic which is used to control behaviour of your application.With each controller $scope is
                    associated with it which is
                    available in you template using two way binding concept of angular which is pretty awsome.<br>
                    <strong>Services/Factory</strong> You can use services to organize and share code across your
                    app.Each
                    component dependent on a service gets a reference to the single instance generated by the service
                    factory.AngularJS offers several useful services (like $http), but for most applications you'll
                    also want to create your own.To use an AngularJS service, you add it as a dependency for the
                    component (controller, service, filter or directive) that depends on the service. Generally we
                    use service for writing business logic, interacting with server(making API calls) and code sharing.<br>
                    <strong>Directives</strong> directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element
                    name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified
                    behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and
                    its children.AngularJS comes with a set of these directives built-in, like ngBind, ngModel, and
                    ngClass. Much like you create controllers and services, you can create your own directives for
                    AngularJS to use.You need to pass Directive Definition Object which provide instruction to compiler
                    to create a new directive.<br>
                    <strong>Dependency Injection</strong> Dependency injection is a technique whereby one object (or
                    static method) supplies the dependencies of another object.AngularJS injector subsystem is in
                    charge of creating components, resolving their dependencies, and providing them to other components
                    as requested.It really makes you development very fast and easy.<br>
                    <strong>Data Binding</strong> Data-binding in AngularJS apps is the automatic synchronization of
                    data between the model and view components.When the model changes, the view reflects the change,
                    and vice versa.
                </p>
                <div class="container flex-center article-img-div">
                    <img class="article-img half-image" src="/assets/img/angular_reach.svg">
                    <div class="img-desc">Angular popularity </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    So start learning and building your web application in AngularJS as its a super easy and fast JS framework.
                </p>
                <h4>Note</h4>
                <p>
                    You may want to use newer version of <a target="_blank" href="https://angular.io/">AngularJS</a> which is much more powerfull and by provide developers angular cli,
                    you can now build you web app much more faster and get a better user experience.
